# tennis-project
 Model implementation for future prediction of win or lose for tennis matches.
Performed EDA on the accquired datasets to understand the data distribution and applied necessary transformations.
Applied feature engineering to create more meaningful features for better performance.
Build a classification model using Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms. XGBoost outperformed other algorithms with 99% accuarcy.
Deployed the classification model using Fast API.
